# Current Progress

The frontend (React, Tailwind, TypeScript) is now fully integrated with the backend (Python, FastAPI, Supabase).
Users can enter a prompt, which is sent to the OpenAI API to generate a flashcard set.
Each generated set is saved to the database and linked to the current userâ€™s ID.
Flashcard sets are displayed in an animated list, allowing users to select and view different sets dynamically.
UI improvements and a consistent theme have been introduced to enhance the user experience.
